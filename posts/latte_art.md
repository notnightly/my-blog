### What is Latte Art?

- Latte art is made by making microfoam on top of the milk that you need to pour
  in the espresso, and then pouring it so that it creates a pattern or a design
  on top of the drink.
- Usually the microfoam is made by using a steamer but since we do not have an
  espresso machine, we will be using a hand frother.

### Materials

To make latte art first you need to have the following materials

- A hand frother

These things cost like 200 rupees on Amazon. [This](https://amzn.in/d/9JXKKDs)
is the one I have (I would recommmend getting a rechargable frother)

- A milk pitcher (very important)

Allows you to pour your milk into the cup precisely and not spill it.

- A cup

Any cup that has a wide opening will do.
