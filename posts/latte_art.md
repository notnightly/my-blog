## What is Latte Art?

- Latte art is created by making microfoam, which is a fine, velvety foam on top
  of steamed milk. This microfoam is then poured into espresso in such a way
  that it forms a pattern or design on the surface of the drink.
- Usually the microfoam is made by using a steamer but since we do not have an
  espresso machine, we will be using a hand frother.
- The most common designs are the heart, the rosetta, and the tulip. I still
  cannot make any of these designs lol.

## Materials

To make latte art first you need to have the following materials

#### A hand frother

These things cost like 200 rupees on Amazon. [This](https://amzn.in/d/9JXKKDs)
is the one I have (I would recommmend getting a rechargable frother)

#### A milk pitcher (very important)

Allows you to pour your milk into the cup precisely and not spill it.

#### A cup

Any cup that has a wide opening will do. Do not use a cup that is too small.

#### Milk

I use Amul Gold milk. You can use any milk you like. Whole milk is the best to
use for latte art since it creates a smoother, more luscious foam.

#### Espresso

I use Nescafe Classic. You can use pull an espresso shot if you have an espresso
machine.

#### A microwave safe cup (optional)

If you want to heat the milk in the microwave, you will need a microwave safe
cup.

#### A thermometer (optional)

If you want to check the temperature of the milk, you will need a thermometer.

## The Method

- First, you need to **froth** the milk. To do this, first heat the milk in the
  microwave for 1 min 30 seconds at 600W (approx) so that it is warm (around
  50 - 70 degrees celsius). You may use a thermometer to check the temperature
  or you can touch the milk and if it is warm, it is ready. Make sure it is not
  too hot. You may use a microwave safe cup for this.
- Secondly, transfer the milk to the milk pitcher and touch the pitcher to check
  if it is too hot to touch (if it is, wait for a few seconds).
- Insert the frother into the milk and turn it on. The technique is to keep the
  frother up the milk so that it introduces air into the milk. This is what
  creates the microfoam. Then incorporate the foam into the milk by putting the
  frotter at the bottom of the pitcher and creating a whirlpool. This will make
  the foam and the milk mix together and create a velvety texture.
- Once you have frothed the milk, pour it into the cup with the espresso. To do
  a simple heart,
  [pour the milk into the cup from a height of 1-2 inches and
  then move the pitcher in a circular motion.](https://clivecoffee.com/blogs/learn/latte-art-how-to-pour-a-heart)
  This post has a good guide on how to pour a heart.
- Enjoy your latte!

## Conclusion

Do not expect to make perfect latte art on your first try. I still cannot make a
perfect heart and it takes a lot of practice to get it right. Next time you
drink a latte, try to make a design on it. It is a fun process and it is very
satisfying to see a design on your drink.

```
1. First thing first your frother has a bent wand and not doing the work properly, good thing is you can straighten it, 
2. 60 seconds is too much, once you figure out the position after big bubbles disappear you keep same position 20 more seconds and done
3. you let the milk sit while doing the coffee, the coffee should be done first then pour the milk because the froth and the milk are going to separate ( not like steam milk which is more silky )
4. the most important thing, your milk was more milk than air hence the weak froth, you add air about 4-5 seconds.
